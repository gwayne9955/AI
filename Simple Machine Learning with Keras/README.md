# Simple Machine Learning With Keras
Artificial Intelligence

### Single Neruon Networks, with and without Keras
Uses the Sigmoid function to test against training data for a binary classification of linear fit. This training data is made of one-dimensional arrays of three elements, and the expected output is the value at one of the indicies.

### Double Layer Neruon Networks, with and without Keras
Uses the same Sigmoid function as well as back-propagation to test with the training data to also binarily classify data that is not linear. This requires the use of a "Hidden" Layer inbetween the input and output layers of the neural network. The expected output is the XOR of the first two elements of the array being tested.
